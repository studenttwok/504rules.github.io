				<p>During the SR, the players can choose the following actions: <b>deal shares, pass or quit</b>.</p>
				<p><b>Dealing Shares:</b> When you take this action you buy 1 share and/or sell any number of shares. During the same SR a player can either buy or sell stocks from a given company; he cannot do both.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Buying Shares:</b> The player pays the share value to the bank. {{#9.I}}If the company owns any shares, the player takes a share from the company and the company gets the fixed issue price (starting price) from the bank. Otherwise, t{{/9.I}}{{^9.I}}T{{/9.I}}he player takes a share from the bank. 
					The player should place the share light side up in front of himself, to indicate that he cannot sell shares of that company this SR. Each player may only own a maximum of 50% of the shares of a single stock company. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Establishing a stock company:</b> If the player buys the first share of a stock company, he must buy the "2"-president&rsquo;s share for twice the fixed issue price and become the president of that stock company.
					The president marks the issue price of that stock company on the share value board (if necessary he places the share value token on top of other tokens). {{^mapnum.1}}{{^mapnum.2}}{{^mapnum.3}}During the first SR all capitals are placed in the central city.{{/mapnum.3}}{{/mapnum.2}}{{/mapnum.1}}{{^mapnum.4}}{{^mapnum.5}}The president then chooses his company&rsquo;s capital.{{/mapnum.5}}{{/mapnum.4}} In the business round (BR) he will make all of its actions.

				{{#4}}{{^8.I}}{{^8.II}}<p><b>"Puppy Licence" provision:</b> An opposing stock company may only be attacked after it finishes its first BR. In other words, it is safe after establishing, as long as it only has a marked capital.</p>{{/8.II}}{{/8.I}}{{/4}} 
				<p>
					<b>Establishing in later SR:</b> If Stock Companies are established in later rounds they may place their capital {{^mapnum.1}}{{^mapnum.2}}{{^mapnum.3}}on any city, which already has 1 settlement of at least one other company{{/mapnum.3}}{{/mapnum.2}}{{/mapnum.1}}{{^mapnum.4}}{{^mapnum.5}}in any city, which is not already marked as a capital of another company{{/mapnum.5}}{{/mapnum.4}}.

				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Being President:</b> A player remains as president of a company as long as they have the most shares of a company (equal most counts). If the president ever has fewer shares in their company than another player, 
					the player with the most shares in that company becomes the new president, he must exchange 2 of his "1" shares for the president&rsquo;s "2" share. If there is a tie, it is broken in favour of the next player clockwise from the previous president.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Selling Shares:</b> The sale price always matches the actual share value. Independent of the number of sold shares, the share value of the concerned stock companies drops by $10. 
					The president cannot sell the President&rsquo;s "2" share, however they can exchange their "2" share for two "1" shares with the next player who could become president during their sell shares action. 
					{{#9.I}}The players together may only sell 50% of the shares of a single stock company to the bank. {{/9.I}}
					{{#9.II}}The players may sell all "1"-shares to the bank (only the president&rsquo;s share must remain in the ownership of a player). {{/9.II}}
					The first time a player sells shares of a company during the SR, he places 1 resident from that company&rsquo;s stocks in front of himself, to indicate that he cannot buy shares of that company this SR.
				</p>
				<p><b>Pass:</b> As long as nobody quits, a player may repeatedly pass and during the same SR may later deal shares, when it is his turn in the clockwise order. If all players pass consecutively the SR ends and the first passing player gets the starting player card.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Quit:</b> If the player quits first in the SR, he takes the starting player card and places it with the crossed out side face up in front of himself. He will be the new starting player 
					in the next SR. After the first player quits, the other players now either must deal shares or quit, too. The SR ends, after all players quit (or if all players pass consecutively).
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>End of the SR:</b> The companies whose shares are now 100% owned by players raise their stock price by $10{{#9.II}}, <b>AND</b> the companies whose shares were bought most during this SR also raise their stock price by $10 (stocks can raise from both in one SR){{/9.II}}.
					Players flip all bought shares back to their dark sides and return residents back to the companies&rsquo; storages.
